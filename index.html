<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 12pt;">The University of Georgia, also known as RBU (Running Back University), has dominated the running back position in college football for the past decade. In the 2017-2018 football season Sony Michelle and Nick Chubb led the Bulldogs to a win in the Rose Bowl and an NCAA Championship appearance. Chubb and Michelle, assisted by D&rsquo;Andre Swift, combined to rush for over 3,000 yards. Both Chubb and Michelle have become feared rushers in the NFL after their careers at the University of Georgia, while Swift is currently a sophomore on the team.</span></p>

<p>Although the statistics shown above in <strong>Table 1</strong> demonstrate Georgia&rsquo;s ferocious rushing offense during the 2017 football season, Chubb and Michel continue to show their dominance in the NFL. Nick Chubb, a rookie on the Chicago Bears, has proven himself to be a feared running back in the NFL, rushing for 663 yards through the Bears first twelve games. Furthermore, Sony Michel has taken the NFL by storm, gaining 586 yards rushing for the New England Patriots through eight games.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Former UGA Running Backs</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Todd Gurley</strong>, a former member of the Georgia Bulldogs, is currently in the running for leauge MVP and is thought to be the best running back in the NFL at the moment. His full-throttle running style leaves defenders in the dust and toughness makes him one of the most ferocious running backs in the league.</p>
<p><strong>Hershel Walker</strong>, one of the greatest funning backs of all time, is also a former Georgia Bulldog. Walker changed the definition of a true running back and his legacy runs through campus on a daily basis. Walker was a threat every time he touched the ball, and his dominant running style is the greatest example of how to be a true beast on the field.</p>
